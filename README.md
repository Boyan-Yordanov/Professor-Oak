<h3 align="center">1st Generation Pokemon Chat Bot</h3> 

Welcome to the first *Group Project* for the MSci Computer Science course in Coventry University! We are excited to present Professor Oak, a chat bot that provides information regarding 1st generation Pokemon and the latest Pokemon news.

<h3 align="center">Overview</h3> 

Professor Oak is a chat bot that utilizes APIs to gather data from Twitter and Google Spreadsheets. In addition to these APIs, we also incorporated a SQLite database that contains all 1st generation Pokemon sorted by type and power. The bot has been integrated with Discord, allowing users to interact with it in a Discord server.

<h3 align="center">Getting Started</h3>

To interact with Professor Oak, you will need to add the chat bot to your Discord server. Once the bot has been added, you can begin sending messages to it. To get started, simply type `!help` to see a list of available commands.

<h3 align="center">Keywords</h3>

Professor Oak responds to several keywords related to 1st generation Pokemon. Here are some examples:
> "!pikachu" - returns information about Pikachu, such as its description, stats, and evolution.
> "!water" - returns a list of all 1st generation Pokemon that are Water type.
> "!charmander" - returns information about Charmander's evolution line, including its evolutions and their levels.
> "!legendary" - returns a list of all 1st generation legendary Pokemon.

<h3 align="center">APIs</h3>

Professor Oak utilizes two APIs to gather information about Pokemon:
> Twitter API - Professor Oak searches Twitter for the latest tweets from the official Pokemon account, and shares them on demand.
> Google Sheets API - Professor Oak accesses a Google Spreadsheet containing information about 1st generation Pokemon. This information includes the Pokemon's name, type, stats, and evolution line.

<h3 align="center">Database</h3>

We created a SQLite database to store all the 1st generation Pokemon sorted by type and power. This allows users to easily search for Pokemon by type and power level. To access the database, users can simply type "!database" followed by the type or power level they are searching for.
